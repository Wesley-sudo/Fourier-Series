 A full video explanation of the Fourier Series by 3 Blue 1 Brown Youtube Channel. I highly suggest to watch the full video, not only that it is interesting but also a very entertaining visualization.

https://shinao.github.io/PathToPoints/ for converting the SVG file to an array of points that I used for the discrete fourier function.

Step by step on How to use this program.

Step 1: Create any design you like, using either the 1st link in the "credits to:" or any tool that you like as long as it will be saved as an SVG file.

Step 2: Convert the SVG file by dragging and dropping it on the 2nd link in the "credits to:" to generate the list of points.

Step 3: Copy and Paste the whole list of points to a new <NAME>.js file. #If you are using VSCode: Ctrl + A, then Shift + Alt + I, then Brackets, then add Coma at the end of each line, then add "let <NAME> = " in the beginning.

Step 4: Change the variables in the main.js file and then run it in the browser.
